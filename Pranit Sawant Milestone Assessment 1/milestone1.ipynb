      "* **Targets:** Servers named FIN12, SRV-DB01, SRV-LNX-12, SRV-APP2, WKS-72, and WKS-22.\n",

      "3. **Remediate affected systems:** Fix vulnerabilities, reset credentials, and restore data from backups.\n",
      "4. **Educate employees:** Implement phishing awareness training and educate users about recognizing and avoiding phishing attacks.\n",
      "5. **Continue monitoring:** Monitor network activity for any suspicious behavior and update security measures accordingly.\n",
