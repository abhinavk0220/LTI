Insurance Claim Adjudication System Walkthrough
I have successfully built the Multi-Agent Insurance Claim Adjudication System using LangGraph.

Implementation Details
1. Data & RAG
Policy Rules: Created 
data/policies/coverage_rules.md
 with 12+ policy points.
RAG: Implemented using FAISS and HuggingFaceEmbeddings (Local Execution).
No API Key Required: The system runs entirely locally using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model.
2. Agents & Workflow
The system consists of the following nodes:

parse_claim_details
: Extracts cost, incident type, and submitted docs using rule-based logic.
retrieve_rules_rag
: Fetches relevant policy clauses using local vector search.
check_document_completeness
: Identifies missing documents.
input_simulator
: Simulates the user providing missing documents (Looping logic).
fraud_detection_agent
: Calculates fraud score based on heuristics.
settlement_computation
: Applies depreciation and deductibles.
final_report_builder
: Generates the final output.
3. Verification Results
I ran the 
main.py
 script with a sample claim (Accident, missing license).

Final Output:

*** INSURANCE CLAIM ADJUDICATION REPORT ***
-------------------------------------------
Incident Type: Accident
Damage Cost: RS 45000.0
Policy Clauses Applied:
- (Retrieved Policy Content...)
Fraud Score: 10/100
Settlement Calculation:
- Base Amount: 45000.0
- Depreciation: 10%
- Deductible: RS 1000
- Final Estimate: RS 39500.0
Status: Approved
Missing Documents: None
-------------------------------------------
The system correctly identified the missing document, looped back, and produced a final approved settlement report using local resources.
