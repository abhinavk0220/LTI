  "response": " Based on the retrieved incidents and entities, I recommend the following actions to address the high level of risk:\n\n1. Block IPs 192.168.55.20 and 172.22.9.54 temporarily as a precautionary measure until their legitimacy can be confirmed. If necessary, reset passwords for affected users to ensure the security of their accounts (Incident #037, #029, #012).\n\n2. Implement host-based intrusion prevention systems (HIPS) or endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions on all hosts mentioned in the incidents (SRV-LNX-12, SRV-FS01, SRV-WIN-02, SRV-SSH01, SRV-DB03, WKS-81, SRV-APP2) to monitor and prevent similar incidents in the future (Incident #037, #029, #012, #038).\n\n3. Regularly update antivirus definitions and signatures on each host to ensure they can detect and block newly emerging threats (all incidents).\n\n4. Consider enforcing least privilege policies for users to restrict their access to necessary resources only, minimizing the impact of successful incident attempts (all incidents).\n\n5. Provide security awareness training to users to educate them about common social engineering tactics used in these types of attacks (all incidents).\n\n6. Conduct a thorough investigation into the source and purpose of each incident as they may represent advanced threats or indicate an ongoing campaign against your organization (Incident #037, #029, #012, #018, #039, #038).\n\n7. For the specific incidents involving SSH login anomaly, suspicious SSH key usage, and large outbound data transfer, revoke the suspicious keys, enforce rotation, and investigate the data that was transferred (Incident #018, #039, #038).\n\n8. Monitor log files for any indicators of compromise (IOCs) related to the observed operating systems, MITRE techniques, and hostnames (all incidents). This can help you identify and block further attempts more quickly.\n\n9. Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) across all hosts to secure user accounts and make it harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access (all incidents).\n\n10. For the incident involving obfuscated JavaScript execution, block the JavaScript and investigate the file source to determine if any malicious code was executed or data was exfiltrated (Incident #039)."
